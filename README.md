# MiniScript Compiler

The MiniScript Compiler is a project aimed at building a compiler for the MiniScript programming language. MiniScript is a simple language designed for educational purposes, featuring basic control structures like `if`, `while`, `for`, and simple data types like integers, floats, strings, and boolean values.

## Features

- **Lexer:** Tokenizes input MiniScript code into keywords, identifiers, literals, and symbols.
- **Parser:** Parses MiniScript code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation.
- **Semantic Analyzer:** Performs semantic analysis on the AST to check for correctness beyond syntax.
- **Symbol Table:** Keeps track of variables and functions declared in the code.
- **Code Optimization:** Planned feature for optimizing MiniScript code.
